# QSAR-Biodegradation-ML-Project-Part-1
QSAR Biodegradation (ML Project)
This is a Machine Learning mini project. It's the 1st part of the whole project. The dataset is QSAR Biodegradation. 
In this project we created an adobe spark page and code using python. 
So here we built two predictive models (Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine) to predict the target variable of the dataset. 
We used python on Jupyter Notebook to write the codes.
And performed a comparison between the two predictive models.
Reported the accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score measures as well as the confusion matrix.
